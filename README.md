### LucaSystem
Initial Luca System Engine Alalyze


-Only contains a PAK unpacker, maybe in a future I add repack

My Notes:

	The IMG (CZ0) is a A8R8G8B8 2-Dimensional Image
	Maybe the CZ0 can store more than one Image
	CZ0; CZ1; CZ2 and CZ3 in the header, looks this decide the pixel format
	Tried open CZ1 and CZ3 using textures tools, failed, Maybe is compressed.
	
	The PAK can contains the file name or not, maybe 2 files with same name
