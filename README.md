### LucaSystem
Initial Luca System Engine Alalyze


-Only contains a PAK unpacker, maybe in a future I add repacker.

-Only contains a CZ0 Decoder, maybe i add in a future a importer.

My Notes:

	CZ0; CZ1; CZ2 and CZ3 in the header, looks this decide the pixel format
	Tried open CZ1 and CZ3 using textures tools, failed, Maybe is compressed.
	Maybe the CZ1 is a texture based on pallet?
	
	The PAK can contains the file name or not, maybe 2 files with same name

Translation:

-Acutally we can translate LB Steam Ver. using my modded version in my Specif-Games repositorie

-The FONT.DAT contains one file for font family and size, unk format, srry
